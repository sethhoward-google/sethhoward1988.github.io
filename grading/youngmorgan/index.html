				<h1>An Introduction to Parallax Web Design</h1>
				<div class="content-left">
					<p>Parallax web design is an up-and-coming method of displaying content on a web page that uses a unique set of background images and styles that creates both user engagement and an overall feeling of web euphoria.</p>
					<p>There are many different methods to employ parallax. Some of them involve scrolling, while others involve the movement of the mouse. There are also different pros and cons associated with parallax design due to its specific nature and design. Thus, it is also important to know how to properly use parallax as part of an overall web solution for your personal site, or for your company.

				<h2>The Origins of Parallax Web Design</h2>
				<div class="content-left">
					<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling" target="_blank">an article in Wikipedia</a>, parallax scrolling didn't get its start in web design... rather, it has been around since the 1930's. The article explains:</p>
					<blockquote>"Parallax is a special scrolling technique in computer graphics, wherein background images move by the camera slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D video game and adding to the immersion. The technique grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation since the 1930s, and was popularized among video games in the 1982 arcade game Moon Patrol."</blockquote>
					<p>Perhaps many of you can still remember those sweet memories of Mario or Luigi riding Yoshi through the many awe-inspiring levels within Super Mario World. Whether or not you recognized it, the scenery was moving at different places around you. For example, the ground and all of the bad guys around you were in the foremost layer, going the fastest. Perhaps in the mid-layer, there were some bushes and small hills. Still further were bigger hills or mountains, and finally the clouds in the sky as the background layer. Each layer moved progressively slower to give you the illusion that you were moving naturally… THAT’S PARALLAX! The example to the right gives a great example of how this is done.</p>

				<h2>The Pros of Parallax</h2>
				<p>In my opinion, using parallax correctly takes a great deal of skill. There are few reasons to create a parallax web page, but when done In the right way, these special pages can knock the socks off any audience. Below are a few possible reasons why parallax might be a good idea for you next site.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Parallax impreses site visitors with amazing page depth and neat effects</li>
					<li>Parallax allows the site to tell a chapter-by-chapter story</li>
					<li>Parallax makes page visits last longer by encouraging visitors to scroll through the entire page</li>
					<li>Parallax allows artistic expression far more than a regular site could... it's art in motion.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I have a hunch that parallax web design might be the future of the online news industry. Instead of merely reading a newspaper, a parallax news article will immerse the reader in a content-rich environment where thousands of off chutes are possible. It is a multi-media rich expierence that covers all angles of a story. The New York times has created such an article – an article entitled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall" target="blank">Snow Fall</a>.</p>

				<h2>The Cons of Parallax</h2>
				<p>According to the <a href="http://www.unleashed-technologies.com/blog/2013/08/15/what-parallax-web-design-%E2%80%93-definitions-tips-considerations" target="_blank">Unleashed Technologies Blog</a>, there are indeed some drawbacks to using parallax. The bullet points below come from the aforementioned blog:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>SEO takes a hit, websites with a single page allow only one set of meta information, one effective h1 tag, and one URL</li>
					<li>A ton of images and other information on one page cause slow load times, causing frustrated visitors to leave the page before they even see it</li>
					<li>Not compatible with responsive and mobile design</li>
					<li>No internal page linking throughout the website</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The key to parallax is to use it for the right purpose (the right tool for the right job). If you use parallax on a page that is meant to deliver information fast, it’s going to flunk. Conversely, if you use it for a page that has a predisposition towards the enjoyable side of things, then it could blow regular pages out of the water! Use prudence and good judgment.</p>
