				<!-- Introduction to the Website -->
				<h1>Welcome.</h1>
				<p id="welcome">The World Wide Web revolutionized communication and the way we interact with information on a global level.  Two of the most fundamental Web technologies that continue to influence the way we consume and process information online are Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, and Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS.  This Website focuses on the role of HTML5 and CSS3 in modern Web development, with particular emphasis on mobile browsing and Responsive Web Design.</p>
				<!-- Basic history of the Internet and the WWW -->
				<h2>A brief history of the World Wide Web</h2>
				<p>Before getting into the history of the World Wide Web, we need to start by explaining the Internet.</p>
				<h3>The Internet</h3>
				<p>The Internet is a super-duper huge system of networks; a network of networks.  A network is a collection of two or more computers that are linked together in such a way that enables communication between them.  The Internet uses standardized methods of communication to exchange information between computers (hosts) and networks.</p>
				<img class="content-images" alt="Representation of the Internet" src="img/map-of-internet.png">
				<h3>The World Wide Web</h3>
				<p>The WWW is a collection of documents that are accessed through the Internet.  These documents are written in hypertext - a special type of text designed for computers, which is also used to describe/define links to other documents, images, and other media.  Hypertext is powerful because of its structure and hidden elements, which control the display of information, and connection to other documents.</p>
				<p>In short, the Internet and WWW is an enormous electronic system of files that allow people like you and me to access and view it in pretty formats that we can read.  Hypertext Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets help us to access and read that information in a way we can understand.</p>
				<!-- Mobile computing and RWD -->
				<h2>Mobile computing and Responsive Web Design</h2>
				<p>Advancements in computing technologies put the World Wide Web in people's pockets.  Today, the wide variety of screen sizes and resolutions, along with varying browsers and hardware capabilities, make Web design and development an even more interesting task.  In order to respond to these changes (no pun intended), the concept of Responsive Web Design came about.</p>
				<p>Responsive Web Design addresses the issue of varying screen sizes and a wide range of potential visitors by using Web technologies to serve up or dynamically present content on Web pages.  To learn more about Responsive Web Design (or RWD), click on the link below.</p>

				<!-- HTML5 summary -->
				<h2>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h2>
				<p>HTML is a markup language (NOT a programming language) that is used to structure, present, and link content accessible on the World Wide Web.  HTML5 is the fifth version/revision of HTML, and is pretty amazing.  To learn more about HTML, click on the link below.</p>
				<p><a href="html5-introduction.html">Go to the HTML5 section</a></p>
				<!-- CSS3 summary -->
				<h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>
				<p>As the name implies, Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is all about style.  While early versions of CSS were dedicated to more static forms of styling Web pages, fantastic developments in technology have made CSS an integral part of the World Wide Web.  CSS3, the third version of CSS, supports and enables several key features of Web pages that we use on a daily basis.  To learn more about CSS3, click on the link below.</p>
