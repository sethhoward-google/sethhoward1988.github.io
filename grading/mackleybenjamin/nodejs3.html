			<h1>What is node.js?</h1>
			<p>
			Node.js is a server-side library for the javascript language.  The idea behind node.js is to build fast web-applications.  The way that node is able to run quicker is through an event-driven non-blocking I/O model. So basically the language doesnt stop to communicate with the server.  Since node is a server side language, the back-end is written in javascript as well, which makes it easier for first time programmers.  The developer who created node.js did so because he was looking for a way to run applications without having to pause for the server, and javascript was one the best option for a language without a library.

			<p>
				Beginners may find node complicated because the server architecture has to be handled by the designer.  So servers such as Apache are only run with Node.js if they already exist and a parallel implementation takes place.  Despite the difficulty, many modules are available to help the development process.  Node.js is especially useful when trying to handle many users, something that is advantageous to other languages like PHP.
