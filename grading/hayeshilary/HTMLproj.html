                    <h2>What is User Experience?</h2>
                    <p>User Experience (UX) refers to the interaction of a human (end user) with a system which may range from products to services. User experience encompasses the user's feelings, attitudes, and behaviors with the system. </p>

                        <h3>Where did UX originate from?</h3>
                        <p>Donald Norman, who spends his time as a user experience architect, was the first person to use the term "user experience" and has since evolved this term into something much larger and more meaningful that truly encompasses the importance of the end user interaction with the system. The idea of the user experience and user centered design has been around since the 1940's but has not become widely accepted and popular until the 1990's.</p>

                        <h3>Why is UX important?</h3>
                        <p>We live in a world that is filled with technology that people use on a daily basis. People around the globe are using mobile phones, tablets, computers, etc. to access information about anything and everything. They want it fast and they want the process by which they obtain the information to be simple. The end users are those that will either make or break the business you work for and it is critical that you provide them with the experience they desire. With that being said, it is time to replace the outdated methodology of designing for the designer with the new methodology of designing with the end user in mind.
                        Designing a web page or any sort of system with the user experience in mind will provide many benefits to the business. If the user experience is less than desirable, end users may come back and say that they do not like how the system is functioning which may actually be a result of poor system design. 
                        A system is created to serve a purpose for the end user. It would make sense to know then that when a customer is dissatisfied with functionality or usability, it all comes back to the user experience.
                        When designing a system that your end user will interact with, going a step further and creating a positive experience rather than something that barely meets minimum requirements will greatly increase end user satisfaction while also saving labor and time for the system design and development team.</p>

                                <li>Attracting new end users</li>
                                <li>Increasing end user satisfaction and loyalty</li>
                                <li>Intriguing end users to converse, share, and promote</li>
                                <li>Reducing operating costs spent on maintaining and improving the experience once deployed</li>

                        <h3>How do you implement UX Design?</h3>
                        <p>User Experience can sometimes be tricky to implement since it largely relies upon end users feelings which are subject to change. Another tricky element of UX design is that no one audience feels the same. It is important to understand the audience to which the system or web application is intended for. Every audience is unique and will react and feel differently to one website than another. It is crucial to understand those you are designing for on an intimate level. It is not enough to base user experience design on page views and other numerical statistics; a true UX designer will get to know his audience personally and understand their needs.</p>
