	    				<ul>
							<li><strong> Aesthetics:</strong> focuses on the product looking good. The product needs to be "fun" to interact with and it has a "clean" layout. In other words, the product has to be attractive to the eye.</li>

							<li><strong>Functionality:</strong> focuses mainly on the value that it gives the user. For example, it is valuable that a user can run an antivirus on their computer. They might not know how to run and they have to figure it out, but it has value.</li>

							<li><strong> Usability:</strong> focuses on guaranteeing that the product is effective, efficient, satisfying, and simple. Usability is how functionality is delivered to users.</li>

					<h2>Delivering Value</h2>
					<p>A user cannot get a positive emotional value, without some utilitarian value.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Emotional Value:</strong> this value can be perceived when a user says, "I love my iPod!"</li>
						<li><strong>Utalitarian Value:</strong> this value can be percieved when a user says, "A mobile phone? Wow! Now I can call my friends from anywhere!"</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Organizations that can deliver both, emotional and utalitarian value, have managen to provide their customers with the best UX. Organizations that follow these standards also share the following characteristics:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>They have expertise in house and/or call on experts in UX when they need it.</li>
						<li>They use appropriate techniques to obtain and understand user input.</li>
						<li>The leadership and culture in the company appreciates the value and necessity of UX design from a business point of view.</li>
						<li>There are connected and integrated processes that enable individuals to work together to create the user experience of the products.</li>
						<li>The principles of UX design are applied in the broadest perspective possible to drive consistent customer experience.</li>

						<h2> How to Start Working on Your UX? </h2>
						<div class="content">
							<div class="text-left">
								<p> Like any model, this 5-stage framework may not exactly match the specifics of a particular organization. In the real world, companies display a mix of characteristics from different stages across their organization. Nevertheless, assessing your company against these broad categories still provides useful insights into how to evolve your business to create better user experiences in the products that reach your customers.</p>

								<p>Organizations and people learn by doing! So identify a project or product where the value of UX design can be showcased (if you are early stage) or enhanced and integrated (if you are more sophisticated). Consulting the indicators of UX maturity in our table, zero-in on the key aspects of the project to target for greater UX design impact.</p>

								<p>Sustaining progress over the longer term is challenging. But the starting point is almost always a single successful project. For the best chance of success, kick things off with UX design education or training for key team members, and cap the project with a formal debrief that evaluates the success of the design process and its impact on the product.</p>

								<p>It's also a good idea to involve a business savvy expert in UX design to help you lever this project to spark change in the company. The person may already exist within your organization or you may need to tap into some outside help.</p>
