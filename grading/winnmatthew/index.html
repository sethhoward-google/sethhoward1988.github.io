				<h2>A Brief Introduction to MySQL</h2>
				<p>
				MySQL (the DBMS) first made its debut in 1995 from the Swedish company MySQL AB,
				later acquired by Sun Microsystems, and then by Oracle. It was created by David Axmark, 
				Allan Larsson, and Michael "Monty" Widenius (incidentally, MySQL was named after Monty's
				daughter, My). The "SQL" part, of course, stands for "Structured Query Language," which
				is a special-purpose programming language for the majority of database management systems
				(relational databases) around the world.
				</p>
				<p>
				It was released under the GNU General Public License, which made it open-source software
				for the free use of everyone. Fortunately, due to the GNU license and the fact that it 
				performs abnormally well under heavy read-write stress for a free DBMS, it has become the
				second most widely used open-source DBMS (second only to 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sqllite">SQLite</a> which comes pre-installed on 
				all iOS and Android devices as well as with Chrome and Firefox web browsers).
				</p>
				<p>
				Together with MySQL Workbench, a free integrated graphical enviroment, MySQL is 
				surprisingly easy to use. You can create running scripts to create and update database
				schemas, or you can use the Workbench to set up the tables and their relationships manually.
				Because of this ease of use and competence with relatively high loads, MySQL has become
				a favorite for companies to use on their websites. Currently, MySQL is employed by
				Wikipedia, Google (though not for searches), Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and thousands
				of other websites.

				<h2>Why is MySQL so great (besides being FREE)?</h2>
				<div>
				<h3>Scalability</h3>
				MySQL is surprisingly scalable for a relational DBMS. While maintiaining only about
				a 1MB footprint, it can manage terabytes of data - and for free.
				</div>
				<div>
				<h3>Compatibility</h3>
				MySQL is one of the few high-scale DBMSs that can work on nearly any operating system.
				So you can use it no matter what you're running on!
				</div>
				<div>
				<h3>Performance</h3>
				Due to a unique architecture, MySQL is a step ahead of other free
				DBMSs in terms of speed and read-write loads - it can handle billions of requests per day.
				</div>
				<div>
				<h3>And Many More!</h3>
