NOTES:
The section element represents a generic document or application section…The section element is not a generic container element. When an element is needed only for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the div element instead. A general rule is that the section element is appropriate only if the element’s contents would be listed explicitly in the document’s outline.

					I am a first year MISM student.  I currently work for Anglepoint consulting.  My interests include web programming and mobile development. 
					
					</p>
					<p>
					My favorite language to program in as of late is Google Apps Script.  There are a lot of really cool things you can do if you already use a lot of Google products, like Gmail, Google Docs, or Google Calendar.
					One script I wrote iterated through many google spreadsheets to make the same change to all of them.  I did this for a friend that is leading a group of interns and needed spreadsheets to track their progress.  He wanted the formula in a specific cell changed, and it would have meant opening and changing many many cells by hand.  This was a lot easier, and more fun too.

					I also really enjoy soccer and really any other sport.  Except basketball, I'm really bad at basketball.

						What is a web service?
					</h1>

					<section>
						<p>
						A program that runs on a server to provide information or processing to a third party.  An example of a web service might be a program that converts currency when given an amount and a beginning and ending currency.  To be a web service, this program would run on a server and would be accessed programatically by another application.

					<h2>
						What is a RESTful web service?
					</h2>
					<p>
					REST is a standard that dictates how a web service should act.  REST stands for Representational State Transfer.  The main principles of REST are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All resources are identified uniquely</li>
						<li>Link resources together</li>
						<li>Use of known methods</li>
						<li>Spcify the format of results</li>
						<li>stateless communication</li>

					</ul>
					<h2>
						HTTP methods
					</h2>

					<p class="citation">http://www.w3.org/2005/Talks/1115-hh-k-ecows/#(1)</p>
						<ul>
						<li>GET - retrieve data from server</li>
						<li>POST - create or update data on server</li>
						<li>PUT - like post, except stateless</li>
						<li>DELETE - removes data from server</li>
						</ul>
