			<h3>SEO:</h3>
			<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the natural process of making a site and its content highly relevant
			for both search engines and searchers. I would like to reinforce the fact that relevant content is the key to a successful website. 
			Without unique and rich content, you will not drive traffic. 
			</p>
			<p>The Google search results page includes 
			organic search results and features paid advertisement denoted as "Ads" or "Sponsored." Google does not 
			accept money to include or rank sites in its search results and it costs nothing to appear in its organic 
			search results. Google does not have a priority submit that guarantees a top rank on a Google search. 
			Actually, you can submit a request to add your URL to Google's index at <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url?continue=/addurl&amp;pli=1">Webmaster Tools</a> free of charge.
