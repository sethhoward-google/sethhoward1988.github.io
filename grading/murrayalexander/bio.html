                            <h4>Background</h4>
                             <p>I am studying at Brigham Young University, and currently pursuing a Masters degree in Information Systems Management.  I enjoy learning about new technologies and finding ways to use technology to better people's lives and business in general.  I am currently focusing on learning Objective-C while working for a department on campus by working on their translation app for iPhone and iPad.  I enjoy learning about web development, although I currently do not have a lot of experience with it.  I also have a background in training, instructional design, and public speaking.
                            <h4>Interests/Hobbies</h4>
                            <p>Besides technology, I am interested in a wide variety of topics.  I enjoy hiking and running (when I have the motivation to do so).  I also enjoy swimming.  I like to keep up to date on current events and emerging technologies, so I am often reading the news and various blogs online.  Information security is quickly something that is becoming more and more important to me as a result of recent breaches and classes I am taking.  Overall, I really enjoy experiencing new things in life.
