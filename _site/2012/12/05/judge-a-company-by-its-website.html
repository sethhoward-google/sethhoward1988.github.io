<p>Judge a Company By Its Website</p>

<p>I’ve worked for several companies now, and worked on several web projects. There are a plethora of web tools out there now for people to build sleek websites. I have found thus far that the quality of a company can almost directly be correlated to the quality of their web presence. A few things that I look for when judging whether a company is trustworthy, by means of the website, are below.</p>

<p>WordPress or Drupal?</p>

<p>Many companies will choose to use a WordPress or Drupal installation to get their website going. And honestly, it’s not a bad move. It’s a quick way to get a great looking website online fast. It gives you access to tons of templates, a great way for non-technical folk to edit content as well as online store options. If the company is using wordpress or drupal, then here is my take on it.</p>

<p>It’s a non-technical company – They’re using pre-made templates and easy editing to stay away from having to get down and dirty with the code. That’s great. Unless you’re a technical company selling your product on a wordpress. In that case, you might want to think twice before engaging in business with them.</p>

<p>It’s not a well-established company – Clearly they don’t have the funds to be making their own website, hence, they rely on these frameworks to deliver their content.</p>

<p>HOWEVER - Many companies get wordpress and PHP developers to build their site; this is fine. They are building on top of a reliable product. If the website is so well done that you can’t tell if it’s a wordpress or not, then that means they’re pretty credible. But if the first words you read are “Just another wordpress”, get out. Fast.</p>

<p>So, if the company you’re looking to get involved with is still a growing company or non-technical, I would say that you’re OK taking a deeper look. But, if they are a technical company, or a supposed industry leading company, I would back out.</p>

<p>In House Website</p>

<p>Now we’re talking. The company grew a pair and forked out money to have someone develop a website for them, or they have given precious developer time to work on their website. This is a good step in the right direction. Now, the only things that we need to look at are below.</p>

<p>Quality – Just how well done is the website? If you are paying really close attention to detail, do you see mismatching colors? mismatching font sizes? things not aligning properly? weird website effects? odd color combinations? Does anything on their website hurt your eyes? Are any pictures oddly placed or have too much going on? Websites are art, and a company that is not paying attention to small details, certainly isn’t going to pay attention to the details when it comes to you. Their website is their presentation. I can guarantee you that their product will be no better than their website.</p>

<p>About Page - Lastly, another key indicator in my bucket, is the about page. When searching, look at how much effort the company puts at sharing the credit with all their employees, or just management.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look…</p>

<p>This being said, let’s look at a few companies that have gotten it right, as well as a few companies that haven’t.</p>

<p>Ones that got it right</p>

<p>whitehouse.gov - Believe it or not, at the core of our nation’s website is a Drupal installation. However, this website is so well crafted that it would take you a very long time to see anything that remotely resembles Drupal. The telltale signs of Drupal are gone, such as certain .txt files. Remember, not a technical company, so they’re doing just fine.</p>

<p>square.com – A beautifully crafted website. This tech giant has spent a very large amount of time designing every aspect of their website. From the subtle picture transitions, to the general warm feeling that the site gives you, it’s clear that they’ve invested lots of effort into impressing you with the first thing you see.</p>

<p>I know what you’re thinking, these are big names with deep pockets. Let’s look at some small startups here in Utah valley and see what we find.</p>

<p>lucidchart.com – A startup company that also tells the signs of success. It’s plain, nothing in misalignment and so forth. They too have put effort into their website to impress you.</p>

<p>bluelemon.com – A budding restaurant that also has blasted the web with a great site. With a site of this quality, I don’t think I would have a problem sitting down and dining with them.</p>

<p>And now, the bad…</p>

<p>naxum.com - This website looks terrible. The way the front page oddly cycles through their clients. The giant phone number at the top beckoning you to call, the large text and life sized buttons. There is nothing subtle about this page, they’re shoving it in your face. I would steer clear.</p>

<p>mokimobility.com – Another poor example of a website that is filled with bugs and poor design. When hovering over the buttons at the top, the title has a white background. How certain things don’t align properly throughout the site, and how the effects are very linear. The site is too busy and incorporates poor color choices.</p>

<p>krissnik.com - This site seems like a poor attempt to reel in the stupid consumer. It’s poor color choice is hard to read, has a sales pitch directly on their front page, cheesy pictures, and even has left-over templating text in it, like “need some content here…”. Would definitely steer clear of this company. Contrast this with a dark-themed page done… well better, but not perfect: Lime Marketing.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>There you go. There are several well-done websites and several poorly done. Look deep into the website before approaching a company, it will dictate a lot about how they treat you and how much they care about their business. Great websites are not easy to make and require an exhaustive amount of effort and money. Anyone who’s not willing to make that happen is not worthy of your business.</p>

<p>Don’t become just another client, become a valued partner. Choose wisely, and when it comes to companies, I will go as far as to say, you can judge a company by its website.</p>
