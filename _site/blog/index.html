		  	<div class="post-date">21 Aug 2013</div>
			<div class="post">
			  	The idea of this pattern is to create variables that are completely private from the global scope. In the example below, we see that the countervariable cannot be directly accessed. The only way the variable can be manipulated is through the defined methods that the module returns...

			<div class="post">
			  	One of the issues that not only PepsiCo faces, but corporations around the world, is browser adoption. At the rate technology increases, stable browser updates are being released on a monthly basis, with developer versions and nightly builds being released daily and weekly. Clearly, the technology community is pushing web browsing ever farther into the future...

			<div class="post">
			  	It often time occurs that web developers need to display time on a web application. Whether that time be the server time, the current time to the user, the time in New York, etc. For all these functions, how can we come up with a cross browser compatible solution of not only outputting the right time, but also receiving the right time from the user in the format that we want it in. There are several different ways to go about this...

		  	<div class="post-date">05 Dec 2012</div>
			<div class="post">
			  	I’ve worked for several companies now, and worked on several web projects. There are a plethora of web tools out there now for people to build sleek websites. I have found thus far that the quality of a company can almost directly be correlated to the quality of their web presence. A few things that I look for when judging whether a company is trustworthy, by means of the website, are below...

		  	<div class="post-date">09 Aug 2012</div>
			<div class="post">
			  	This was another challenge faced when creating my website. If you go there, you will notice that the navigation column is normally fixed (most noticeable when on the portfolio page), but then on the design page I wanted to use the entire width of the page, but didn’t want my navigation to float on top of the content. So, I had to figure out how to animate it from fixed to absolute smoothly and back again. The following example demonstrates how we can move the element from an absolute position to a fixed position...

		  	<div class="post-date">08 Aug 2012</div>
			<div class="post">
			  	In a recent project that I’ve been working on, I constantly was needing to rotate divs. My first solution, I created my own animation function that recursively called itself on a given interval, which worked pretty well. However, with this solution, I lost the easing capability that was native to jQuery animations. My one option linear easing wasn’t good enough for me, and I also had to deal with figuring out how often the steps happened and so forth and in the end it worked, but didn’t look nearly as pretty as jQuery has it done. So, instead of reinventing the wheel, I looked through the jQuery animate API and created this solution which now works perfectly...
