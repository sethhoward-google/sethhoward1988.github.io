                            <div class="image">
                            <img src="rwd.jpg" />
                            </div>
                            <h4>Introduction</h4>
                             <p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) allows web content to be viewed in the most optimal format for a specific user&#39;s device.  RWD caters to the user&#39;s method of viewing the website whether it be a smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer.  The main ways that RWD accomplishes its responsiveness to the user&#39;s device is through flexible layouts, media queries/listeners, and resizing of images and other media.
                            <h4>Media Queries</h4>
                            <p>RWD uses what are known as media queries to handle the dynamic layout resizing and other manipulations of the web content.   These media queries can check screen size, orientation, whether or not the browser can be resized, and other device characteristics to ensure that the content is displayed in an optimal manner.   An example of how a media query might be used is that it could allow content to look differently on an iPad being held in either a landscape or portrait position.  Media queries, are a large part of what makes RWD possible in that they allow the website to detect the device or browser being used and adapt the content accordingly.
                            <h4>Flexible Layouts</h4>
                            Because mobile devices greatly vary in screen size from traditional desktops and laptops, RWD uses flexible layouts to adjust to these screen sizes.  These layouts are generally based on a grid pattern that resizes the web content according to the user&#39;s screen size.  By specifying optimal layout structures for given screen sizes, content is resized dynamically for the user.  For example, content could be displayed in 3 columns for larger screen sizes, while 1 column might suffice on a smartphone.  To adjust this, code such as <em>&#8220;@media min-width: 1220px&#8221;</em> would require that the screen must be wider than 1220 pixels in order to display the three columns.  In this regard, RWD differs from traditional web design in that it can dynamically resize layout structures based on the user&#39;s screen.  This also provides the option of deleting unnecessary content from the mobile experience.

                                <img src="threecolumns.png" />
                                <img src="onecolumn.png" />
                            </div>
                            <h4>Resizeable Images, Videos, and More</h3>
                            <p>Another key aspect of RWD is that it can allow images and media to be resized and formatted in optimal ways for the user to experience on their respective device.  Obviously, one strength of this is that images would be able to be smaller on mobile devices while still an optimal, larger size on a desktop computer.  Furthermore, RWD suggests the possibility of cropping image content unnecessary for the mobile viewing experience in order to free up precious screen space for other content.

                                <img class='imageDark' src="willie.PNG" />  
                            </div>   
                            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                            Overall, implementing Responsive Web Design can allow a company&#39;s web content to be accessible to users in the way that is most ideal for their specific device.  This is accomplished by resizing content layouts, images, and media dynamically through the use of media queries and other development tools such as CSS.  If a company wants to reach a wide variety of people on the web, I recommend implementing RWD to cater to the wide variety of devices that are now being used to connect to the internet.
