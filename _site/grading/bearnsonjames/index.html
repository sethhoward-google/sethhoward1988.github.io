                        <p>

                        Django is an open source web framework written in the Python language. Django, which uses the model-view-controller pattern, is used to create database-driven websites of varying complexity. The real advantages of Django lie in the reusability of code, rapid development, and the DRY principle (dont repeat yourself). As mentioned above, Django is written in Python, and Python is used throughout in settings, files, and data models. A superior Administrative interface also allows a user CRUD functions based upon the implemented data model. Django is maintained by the Django Software Foundation, which says the following about Django:

                        <blockquote cite="https://www.DjangoProject.com">

                        <h4>Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. </h4>
                        Developed by a fast-moving online-news operation, Django was designed to handle two challenges: the intensive deadlines of a newsroom and the stringent requirements of the experienced Web developers who wrote it. It lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly.
                        Django focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering to the DRY principle.

                        The following page will dive deeper into Django by describing web frameworks in general, diving further into what the model-view-controller pattern is, and how to get started with Django.

                        <h3>What is a Web Framework?</h3>
                        <p>

                        Web frameworks are used to make web development simpler. Web development can come with many tedious, manual tasks. Web frameworks are designed to streamline those tasks and allow the developer more time doing the fun part of web development. To that end, most web frameworks include libraries that help with database access, templating, session management, etc. 

                        Frameworks might implement features differently but most frameworks accomplish simlimar goals. The following frameworks (with languages) are most popular:
                        </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> JavaScript - AngularJS, Express </li>
                                <li> C# - asp.net </li>
                                <li> Python - Django, Flask </li>
                                <li> Java - Spring, Struts, Play </li>
                                <li>  PHP - Zend, CakePHP, CodeIgniter </li>
                                <li> Ruby - Ruby on Rails</li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>
                            MVC stands for Model-View-Controller.

                        <h3> How do I get started?</h3>

                        Django is well documented and has an extensive presence on the web. I recommend that you start on Django's main website: <a href = "Https://www.djangoproject.com"> DjangoProject.com </a> and go from there. DjangoProject offers tutorials/book references/and other community websites.

                        If you are new to Python, then I would suggest that you start with the Dive into Python Book, which can easily be googled.
