This project is designed to fulfill class requirements in IS 542 “web development” for the winter 2014 semester.  This project is not intended to display advanced web development skills nor should it be used as evidence of my skill set in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

My goal is to conform to web standards and implement many best practices as defined by the instructor of the course at the time the course was taught. As a result much of what this repository contains will not necessarily be my best or preferred method of work.  From the course assignment this page will be nothing more than a research page implementing basic web design techniques.  The assignment is detailed below:


                “ Description
                This homework assignment is a 3 week project that will be due in increments. For this assignment, you will select a web technology that you are interested in and research it. After conducting research, you will prepare at least a 2 page website to display the content of your findings. Please ensure that the content is well explained and beneficial to others who may want to learn more about the technology. You may also include how implement your technology, or snippets of code to show how it works. If you want, you can create a biography website with a blog section that includes your technical article. Feel free to write an about me page, a contact page, portfolio, etc.
                 
                So, to clarify, you must have one page dedicated to your technical article, and at least one other page with whatever content you want.
                 
                The base of your code must be written by yourself. You may not use bootstrap or any other css framework. You must write the styles entirely by yourself. Although you may or may not do this in the real world, it is important that you understand how to write your own styles and achieve certain layouts by yourself. That being said, you may use JavaScript libraries such as Modernizr.js, jQuery, Underscore, Zepto, or others. If you choose to use another library not listed here, please get approval by emailing me before using it. I am also OK with using any library both css and js used to achieve code snippet highlighting. Please do not use tools like Jekyll to compile your HTML for you, as well as any drag and drop or WYSIWYG editors. I expect you to write the code from scratch. Feel free to use Mozilla Developer Network as a reference guide as well as StackOverflow for help, they are valuable tools that you will frequently use in the real world.
                 
                Criteria
                You will be graded on the following criteria.
                Multi-paged website, at least 2 pages
                Is the technical article thoroughly explained
                Is the HTML semantically correct
                Is the web design modern
                Is the website optimized
                Is the website lacking something that we reviewed/taught in class
                Does the website display properly in Chrome, Firefox, and IE9”



In addition, there are instructions given in class.  This is not meant to be a complex website this is by assignment classification, a review.
