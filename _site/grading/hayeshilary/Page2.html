                        <h3>Elko, Nevada</h3>
                        <p>Hilary was born and raised in this small town in Northeastern Nevada. She is frequently asked if Elko is close to Las Vegas and always answers with "It's as far away from Vegas as you can get without being in another state."
                        Elko is known for gold mining. Many people move to this small city to be apart of the mining community. There are four big gold mines that keep a large portion of the town population employed. If not known for the gold mining, the Ruby mountains are another famous trademark. The Ruby Mountains tower above the valley floor and are frequently traveled amongst hunters, skiers, and hikers. During every season, the Ruby Mountains, approximately twenty minutes from downtown Elko, are a beautiful place to be.
                        Hilary misses home but enjoys visiting when she can and seeing the rest of the Basque community in which she was raised.
